          <h4>Build your portfolio.</h4>
          <p>The Expo experience is moving online, and <a href="http://olinexpo.heroku.com/">olinexpo.com</a> is a new entry in your portfolio. Your presentation has a dedicated page describing what you accomplished and the student behind the project. It’s a new way to get people excited about what you worked on, and a way to show future employers. </p>

          <h4>Don’t just visit Expo, live it.</h4>
          <p>Expo Live is a conference like no other. With technology developed by Lifegraph, you’ll see schedules tailored to your interests, find out who is interested in your work, and be able to learn more about the sessions you attend. And follow up after to see pictures of the event!</p>
